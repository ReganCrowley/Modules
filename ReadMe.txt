Introduction
 This is my portfolio for module 2 

This website is made up of four areas, they are :
	1. Header
	2. Who is Regan ? 
	3. What can I do ?
	4. Where can you find me ?
	
Header 
 The Header has two distinct parts, the first is the banner which uses a gradient for effect, 
 the second part is for navigation to other areas of the Portfolio page.
 
Who is Regan ?
 I talk about myself and who I am 
 I added a link to my title to explain to anyone unfamiliar with the title and a link to see my current rating.
 
 
What can I do ? 
 I added my education and the coding languages I have learnt and my experiences using computer related tools and applications. 
  
Where can you find me ?
 I added a working google map where the map directs you to the Monash Clayton Campus
 I added an Email me feature but at the moment it only opens up a browser
 I added mobile numbers (the numbers are fake)
 
Flex box
 In this section I borrowed code from W3schools https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp
 The images i found were from google images where they represent who I am as a person
